# spt-randomizer
a WIP mod for SPTarkov



## Core concept
Each time you die, everything you have gets wiped (including stash) and you receive a new gun and some starting money.
If you manage to escape, most items you managed to pull out of the raid (barter items and other weapons) will be automatically sold for reduced prices. Restock, buy whatever mods you can afford, and go in again with a slightly better kit than last time.

## In development
There's a lot of unimplemented features _(and probably a lot of bugs)_, so the mod is likely to receive updates.

## How to use
1. Install it like you would install any other mod.
2. Create a new account on Randomizer edition.
3. Play.

## Config
There's a bunch of nifty settings you can tinker around with, which are located in the mod directory's `config.json`.

## Features
- **Automatic item selling:** Less time spent managing your stash, more time spent fighting off bots.
- **Repurposed secure containers**: Instead of saving your loot after death, they save your loot from being sold upon completing a raid.
- **Price scaling:** Weapons and weapon mods are significantly more expensive than medicine and ammo.
- _more to come..._
